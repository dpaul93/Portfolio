# Portfolio
Challenge week 2 portfolio
In this weeks Challenge, I attempted to create a portfolio. 
Having spend a good day resurching methods and differnt displays I decided to try a grid meathod to create my layout. 
Having created the grid, I soon ran into some formatting issues and couldnt find an easy fix.
After having a study session with a TA it was pointed out to me that the issues I was facing wouldnt be present with a flex design. 
Due to this I decided to re-work my CSS into a flex design and that the format is it now in. 

With more time and research I would like to develop this portfolio and make it more responsive. 
I see this as a V1 and nothing more, further versions would see this hopefully turn into an interactive CV where I will link prospective employeers to items of my work and relivent experience.
